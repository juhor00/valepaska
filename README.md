# valepaska

A card game called valepaska ("fake shit", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paskahousu#Valepaska).
Game is played on a client-server connection using socket programming interface.
Clients play the game using a graphical user interface (to do).

This project replaces old project called "CardGame" which was programmed with Python.
The reason behind changing the language is that the project was not controllable anymore and Python was a bad choice of language.
Also I was not satisfied with most of the implementations I did in the last project.
I try to utilize class inheritance and interfaces (within reason).
I also try to make the server side generic so I can use it on other projects.
